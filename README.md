#### Who I am

Hi, my name is Julian and I am a young student who is on his way to get a computer scientist.
I was always curious about any kind of technology since I was a kid. But as the time continued it got clearer that computers and especially their software gave me the biggest joy when working with them.

#### What I do

The applications I make right now are not very professional but they are a small documentation of my personal development process. There a quite a lot attempts of using Python for something useful and I also dove a bit into web development to make nice GUIs for my applications.

So if you are interestsed in my erly attempts, feel free to visit my GitHub [here](https://github.com/TheMrPixelDev).
